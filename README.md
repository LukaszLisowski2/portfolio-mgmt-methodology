My journey with Python and R

//02.2021
My name is Lukasz Lisowski. I am currently a 2nd year Finance and Management student at Northumbria University. I have started learning Python few months ago independently in order to build my technical skills. I will store here all my financial projects in Python from basic ones to the most challenging ones which will be updated in a future.

Data Science/Finance/Statistics projects*:

1. Basic correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum - 1st project (Python)
2. Monte Carlo Simulation of Alphabet Stock (Python)
3. Black Scholes Implementation Model (Python)
4. Option Pricing for Palantir Technologies using Monte Carlo Geometric Brownian Motion (Python)
5. University assignment portfolio optimization. - Part I (Python)
6. Hierarchial Risk Parity - Part II (Python)
7. Black Litterman Allocation - Part III (Python)

6.Forecasting NIO prices using sGARCH(1,1) model with normal distribution variance (R, Rstudio)
